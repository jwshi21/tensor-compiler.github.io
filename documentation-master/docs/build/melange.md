**Melange** is a feature in ProfilePress that is capable of converting any (combination of) login, registration password reset and even edit profile form template to a working WordPress equivalent.

Examples of what can be built with the **melange** feature is a login, registration and password reset form widget; multi-step registration forms e.t.c.

This [multi-step registration form](http://profilepress.net/downloads/stride-wordpress-multi-step-registration-form/) is an example of what melange is capable of.

Building say a login form with melange is similar to the [normal way](login-form.md). The only difference is, while the latter do not require a container shortcode, the former do which is `[pp-login-form]`,    
`[pp-registration-form]`, `[pp-password-reset-form]` and `[pp-edit-profile-form]` for login, registration, password reset and edit profile form.

Take a look at the **Lucid Account Tab Widget** theme included in ProfilePress to see a live example of how melange works.
