**taco Background**

In this section we will briefly discuss background information. Tensor algebra is a powerful tool for computing
on multidimensional data and has many applications in machine learning, data analytics, engineering and science.

Key Terminology:

* `Tensor`: Generalize matrices to any number of dimensions. They allow for multilinear computations.

* `Sparse Tensor`: A tensor that mostly contains zeros that can often be compressed in representation. 

* `Dense Tensor`: A tensor that is filled with relatively many more nonzero elements.

* `Kernel`: Manages the task of computing tensor operations.
