**taco Background**

In this section we will briefly discuss background information. Tensor algebra is a powerful tool for computing
on multidimensional data and has many applications in machine learning, data analytics, engineering and science.

Key Terminology:

* *Tensor*: Generalize matrices to any number of dimensions. They allow for multilinear computations.

* *Sparse Tensor*: A tensor that mostly contains zeros that can often be compressed in representation. Ex: Amazon Review tensors has $$1.5 \times 10^{19}$$ components but only $$1.7 \times 10^{9}$$ of these are non-zero.

* *Dense Tensor*: A tensor that is filled with relatively many more nonzero elements.

* *Kernel*: Manages the task of computing tensor operations.
