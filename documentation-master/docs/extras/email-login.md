By default, users can only log in to WordPress using their username and password. This can be a pain in the butt to users of your website if they forget their username and thus, they are left with no option but to do a password reset for them to get their username.


ProfilePress include a `log in with email` feature which allows users to log in to your WordPress powered site with their email address instead of a username together with a password.



To activate this feature, click the **Extras** ProfilePress menu and activate it in **Login with Email** section.
