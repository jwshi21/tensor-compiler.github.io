The [Email Confirmation](https://profilepress.net/downloads/email-confirmation/?ref=email_confirm_doc) for WordPress extension ensures new registered users confirm / verify their email addresses before they can log in to WordPress.


After creating or registering an account, the user will receive an email containing a link which when clicked, confirms their email address.

By default, the email confirmation URL or link expires after 30 minutes. You can always change the expiration time at the **Link Expiration** settings field.


It is worth noting that the **Content-type** determines the format of the email confirmation message. I.e. if it will be HTML formatted or plain text.


The following settings configure the error and success notices displayed at various triggered events.

The error and success messages are pretty straight-forward save for the last two.


The **Email Confirmation Resent** notice is displayed when an unconfirmed user after trying to login, click the *resend email confirmation link*. See GIF below for clarity.

## Unconfirmed Users Deletion
One feature I love (and am pretty sure you will too) about this extension is the fact that you can delete users from WordPress database who haven't confirmed or verified their email address after a period of time.


Activate the feature by checking the **unconfirmed user deletion** checkbox and then specifies the number of days unconfirmed users will remain in WordPress before they are deleted
