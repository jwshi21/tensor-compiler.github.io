The [WordPress & BuddyPress Extended Profile Sync](http://profilepress.net/downloads/buddypress-extended-profile-sync/) is a nifty extension that provides a 2-way syncing of WordPress profile fields with BuddyPress extended profile and vice versa.

To get this profile syncing between WordPress and BuddyPress working in your WordPress powered site, ensure you have the [extension](http://profilepress.net/downloads/mailchimp/) together with [ProfilePress premium](http://profilepress.net/pricing/) installed and activated.

When installed and activated, click the **Extras** ProfilePress menu link.


At the **BuddyPress Extended Profile Sync** section, enter your purchase [license key](http://profilepress.net/downloads/email-confirmation/) to receive plugin updates and check the **Activate Addon** checkbox to enable the extension.

When creating a new custom profile field and you check the aforementioned checkbox, a corresponding field type will be created in BuddyPress extended profile (xprofile).

If you are editing an existing profile field and you uncheck the checkbox, the corresponding xprofile field will be deleted. And if you recheck, a corresponding new xprofile field will be recreated.




## How the 2-way Syncing Works

When users sign up with a [registration form](http://profilepress.net/features/wordpress-front-end-registration-form/) or edit their profile information with an [edit profile form](http://profilepress.net/features/wordpress-front-end-edit-profile-form/) with profile fields synced with BuddyPress; on submission of the data entered into the fields, the data automatically get synchronised between them as a result, same information is available when viewed in WordPress & BuddyPress admin profile pages as well as ProfilePress powered front-end profile & edit profile forms and BuddyPress front-end profile view.

Synchronization happens at the follow stages.

* When user sign up with a ProfilePress powered [registration form](http://profilepress.net/features/wordpress-front-end-registration-form/).

* When user edit their profile in WordPress backend / dashboard.

* When users edit their profile in ProfilePress powered [front-end edit profile form](http://profilepress.net/features/wordpress-front-end-edit-profile-form/).

* When users edit their profile in BuddyPress front-end profile.



For example, say you created a "textarea" custom profile field to collect the addresses of users; when this field is updated in BuddyPress profile edit screen, the data get synced with the corresponding default WordPress profile of the users and vice-versa. See a video demo below.
