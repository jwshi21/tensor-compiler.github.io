**[TACO](http://tensor-compiler.org)** is a library for performing sparse and
dense linear algebra and tensor algebra computations. The computations can
range from relatively simple ones like sparse matrix-vector multiplication to
more complex ones like matricized tensor times Khatri-Rao product.  All these
computations can be performed on any mix of dense and sparse tensors. Under the
hood, TACO automatically generates efficient code to perform these
computations.

well as some examples demonstrating how TACO can be used in real-world
applications.

# System Requirements

* A C compiler that supports C99 and OpenMP (if parallel execution is desired), such as GCC or Clang.
* Python 3 with NumPy and SciPy.
